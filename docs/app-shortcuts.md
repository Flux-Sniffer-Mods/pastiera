# Universal app shortcuts

Settings → Apps → App shortcuts. One set of standard key combos means the same
thing in every app. When an app documents its own shortcut for the action,
Pastiera sends that shortcut in place of the combo you pressed. When it doesn't,
a suggested intent can open the app's own screen instead (see "Suggested
shortcuts" below). There are presets for 300+ apps. Every one can be changed
per app, and you can add any other app and record its shortcuts yourself
(keyboard apps can't be added).

Code: `app/src/main/java/it/palsoftware/pastiera/shortcuts/AppShortcuts.kt`
(combos, documented presets, rules), `SuggestedAppShortcuts.kt` (generated
suggestions), `AppIntents.kt`, `AppShortcutSettings.kt` (storage) and
`PhysicalKeyboardInputMethodService.remapAppShortcut` (the key hook).

## Standard combos

| Combo | Action | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Ctrl+N | New (message, note, event, tab) | anywhere |
| Ctrl+F | Search or find | anywhere |
| Ctrl+O | Open or go to | outside text fields |
| Ctrl+R | Refresh | outside text fields |
| Ctrl+Enter | Send | anywhere |
| Ctrl+W | Close or finish | anywhere |
| Ctrl+Shift+R | Reply | outside text fields |
| Ctrl+Shift+A | Reply all | outside text fields |
| Ctrl+Shift+F | Forward | outside text fields |
| Ctrl+E | Archive | outside text fields |
| Ctrl+D | Delete | outside text fields |
| Ctrl+U | Mark unread | outside text fields |
| Ctrl+Shift+S | Star, flag, pin or bookmark | outside text fields |
| Ctrl+Z | Undo the last action | outside text fields |
| Alt+↓ / Alt+↑ | Next / previous item (message, tab, sheet, session) | anywhere |
| Ctrl+M | Menu or side panel | anywhere |
| Ctrl+/ | Keyboard shortcut help | anywhere |

The combos follow common desktop habits where the apps agree: Ctrl+N, Ctrl+F,
Ctrl+R, Ctrl+W, Ctrl+Enter, Ctrl+/. Where the apps disagree, the combo is one
that none of the presets uses for something else.

Rules (`AppShortcutRemapper.resolve`):

- Only a standard combo is ever changed. Plain typing, Alt+letter symbols and
  every other combo go through untouched.
- Pastiera changes nothing when the app's own shortcut is already the standard
  combo. When the app has no shortcut for that action, a suggested intent is
  used if there is one and the app accepts it; otherwise nothing changes.
- In a text field, Pastiera never sends a shortcut that would type a character
  (Gmail's `C`, Keep's `/`) or move the cursor (a plain arrow). It also skips
  actions meant for lists and message views.
- In a text field, only a held Ctrl counts, and only when "held Ctrl uses Nav
  Mode" is off. A latched Ctrl there keeps working as Pastiera's cursor and
  selection keys.
- Termux keeps Ctrl+letter for the shell. Its preset only maps session
  switching.

## Suggested shortcuts: the top apps in every category

Most apps publish no Android keyboard shortcuts. For those, a preset can **suggest** an intent
into the app's own screens, which Pastiera starts when you press the standard combo in that app:

- **New (Ctrl+N):** the app's share screen with nothing filled in, i.e. a new post, message or
  note. Used in Social, Communication, Productivity and Business apps, and in X.
- **Search (Ctrl+F):** the app's own search screen (`ACTION_SEARCH`), and for the best-known
  apps one of their own search links (e.g. `spotify:search`, `https://www.reddit.com/search/`,
  `https://x.com/search`, `geo:0,0?q=` for Google Maps).

These are suggestions, not documented shortcuts. Each intent is aimed at the app itself, and
Pastiera only starts it when that app on the phone accepts it; otherwise the key goes to the
app unchanged. A documented key shortcut always wins over a suggestion. You can turn
suggestions off (Settings → Apps → App shortcuts → Suggested shortcuts), or override them app
by app ("Don't remap", or record the app's own combo).

### Which apps

The apps are Google Play's own categories (US store, September 2026), ranked by downloads and
then by number of reviews: the top 100 in **Social** and the top 10 in each other main category.
Games, keyboards and system components (carrier services, accessibility suite and the like) are
left out, and so is Pastiera. `tools/app-shortcuts/crawl.py` collects the data from Google Play
(each category page plus "similar apps", with Social crawled deeper, 333 Social apps in all),
and `tools/app-shortcuts/generate.py` writes `SuggestedAppShortcuts.kt` and
`tools/app-shortcuts/play-ranking.json` (the ranking used).

Google Play files some big social apps outside Social: X is in News & magazines, Snapchat and
WhatsApp in Communication, Pinterest in Lifestyle, LinkedIn in Business and Discord in
Communication. They appear in those categories' lists. Social itself is mostly live-video and
chat-room apps by download count; Bluesky and Mastodon rank below its top 100.

## Research: which apps document Android keyboard shortcuts

Only shortcuts an app documents for Android, or ships in its own source code,
went into the presets. Desktop and web shortcut lists were not used, because
they often don't work in the Android apps.

`=` means the app already uses the standard combo, so nothing is changed.
